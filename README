Nice, clear, gentle, professional colorscheme from Dev-C++.

By Xi Chen, HyperNewbie, 
based on the nice structure of the Visual C++ theme :)

Its te default Dev-C++ theme with little fix-ups from Kate editor. Nice white-background theme that uses gentle colors and strong colors where appropriate, so you grab the right attention while not killing your eyes.

Should work on most versions of vim...
